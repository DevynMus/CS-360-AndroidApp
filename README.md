# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  The apps main goal was to be able to track inventory levels, using CRUD functionality tied to a front end modern mobile application. It is expected to be able to create, read, update, and delete data fromn within the app.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  When desinging the application, I ensured that ease of use and accessibility were forefront in mind. This helped keep the application neat and organized. The app has 3 main screens, Login, Add Items, and the Inventory view.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  When coding the app, I broke down the main classes and functions I needed, and designed each of them to be as coherent as posible, and did not over-complicate them. 

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  Functionality was tested by creating code tests, and by using the application on my personal device. It allowed me to test each function to ensure it would work on a clean environment and have no issues.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  The overall look and feel of the application showcases its' strength. The layout is modern, precise, and functional. The application proves its success by meeting required functionality set by the requirements, and raises the bar by its' ease of use, accessbility, and logical flow.
